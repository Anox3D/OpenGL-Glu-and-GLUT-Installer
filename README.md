# OpenGL, Glu and GLUT Installer
A easy-to-use program to install OpenGL, Glu and GLUT faster and simpler.

Thanks very much to [@Mathieu Squidward ðŸ¤—](https://discord.com/users/696692880772956180) on [Program Dream](https://discord.gg/gfmaxgE) for writing a better version of my code!

# How to use program
First, you need to download the ZIP file. If you have a 32 bits system, download the 32 bits installer and if you have a 64 bits system, download the 64 bits installer.  
32 bits installer: https://www.mediafire.com/file/0ngbf9n7xs8zdf0/opengl-glu-glut-32bits-installer.zip/file  
64 bits installer: https://www.mediafire.com/file/j2zorg7iuudd0dy/opengl-glu-glut-64bits-installer.zip/file  

When you have downloaded it, unzip it using WinRAR, 7-Zip or the Windows default unzipper. Then run as administrator the installer Batch file.

The program will ask if you really want to copy the files into the path, just right "Yes" for every request.

OpenGL, Glu and GLUT are now installed! You can delete the files you downloaded.
